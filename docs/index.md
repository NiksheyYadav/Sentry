## 🚀 Welcome to Sentry

Sentry is a state-of-the-art framework that uses computer vision and deep learning to assess mental well-being in real-time. By analyzing facial micro-expressions and body posture, it provides objective metrics for stress, anxiety, and emotional states.

### 🌟 Key Features

*   **Hybrid Emotion AI**: Combines Deep Learning (DenseNet) with Geometric Analysis (FaceMesh) for superior accuracy.
*   **Real-time Monitoring**: Processes video at 30+ FPS on standard hardware.
*   **Multimodal Fusion**: Integrates face and posture data for holistic assessment.
*   **Privacy First**: All processing happens locally; no video is ever sent to the cloud.
